AI AMD posts record Q4, but can't beat back the AI malaise By Dan O'Shea Feb 5, 2025 11:23am AMD earnings report artificial intelligence (AI) DeepSeek AMD posted a robust fourth quarter of 2024 that included record quarterly revenue, including record-high sales numbers in both the data center and client computing businesses. Yet, all those records did little to dismiss concerns around future AI market uncertainty and AMD's status as a challenger to Nvidia, as several analysts responded to the quarter by lowering their price targets on AMD stock. The company’s overall revenue for Q4 ‘24 came in at about $7.7 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth and 12% growth from the previous quarter. About $3.86 billion of that take came from the data center market, where segment revenue grew 69% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Client segment revenue hit $2.3 billion in Q4, up 58% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Looking at AMD’s two smaller business segments, gaming sector revenue was the downer of the quarter, as it slipped 59% to $563 million, though it was up sequentially about 22%. Meanwhile embedded segment revenue was down 13% year-over-year to $923 million. For the full year of 2024, AMD revenue reached $25.8 billion, about 14% higher than 2023, as the data center segment accounted for roughly half of that total. Much of that was due to progress with new AI chips, as AMD President and CEO Lisa Su noted on the Q4 earnings call that the company “delivered greater than $5 billion of data center AI revenue for the year.” Remarking on the progress of AMD’s Instinct AI chip family, she added, “Looking at the fourth quarter, MI300X production deployments expanded with our largest cloud partners. Meta exclusively used MI300X to serve its Llama 405B frontier model on Meta.AI, and added our Instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, which is designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads. Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services and launched flagship instances that scale up to thousands of GPUs for AI training and inference and HPC workloads.” Su also noted that IBM late in 2024 said it would put the MI300X on its Watson X AI platform this year. “Instinct platforms are currently being deployed across more than a dozen CSPs globally, and we expect this number to grow in 2025.” The Instinct MI325X is in volume production, and looking further out, she added, “Based on early silicon progress and the strong customer interest in the MI350 series, we now plan to sample to our lead customers this quarter, and we are on track to accelerate production shipments to mid-year. As we look forward to our multi-year road map, I'm excited to share that MI400 series development is also progressing very well.” The timelines Su mentioned are slightly accelerated from previous goals, and she added, regarding future revenue projections, “We see this business growing to tens of billions [of dollars in revenue], as we go through the next couple of years.” AMD CFO Jean Hu said n the earnings call othat after the strong fourth quarter of 2024 the first quarter of 2025 may not compare favorably. “We expect revenue [for Q1 2025] to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, up 30% year over year, driven by strong growth in our data center and the client business.” The company’s gaming business is still expected to see a “significant decline” in Q1, while the embedded business declines more modestly, she said, adding that overall, “We expect revenue to be down sequentially approximately 7%, driven primarily by seasonality across our businesses.” Analysts are not thrilled about AMD's progress amid unease around AI generallyDespite the strong Q4 and positive data center vibes, analysts continue to be unenthused by AMD’s progress and plans. To take just one of several possible examples, Citi lowered its AMD stock price target from $175 to $110, which was lower than the level at which the stock closed on Wednesday just before AMD reported its earnings. As of mid-day Thursday, the price had plunged below that level to about $107 per share. Part of the miasma around AMD has to do with its ongoing status as a distant AI runner-up to Nvidia, but there also has been a growing sense of unease around the AI sector in general and the prospect for slowing growth. Those concerns recently were augmented by the revelation of China’s DeepSeek and the methods it used to reduce the number of GPUs and the power needed to process AI. DeepSeek’s potential effect has been widely downplayed in recent days, and major players like AMD and Nvidia have quickly moved to show how well their products run DeepSeek’s open-source R1 model. Su cast the DeepSeek news in a positive light for AMD, saying on the earnings call, “We think that innovation on the models and the algorithms is good for AI adoption. The fact that there are new ways to bring about training and inference capabilities with less infrastructure actually is a good thing because it allows us to continue to deploy AI compute and broader application space and more adoption. I think from our standpoint, we also like very much the fact that.. we are big believers in open source.” AMD earnings report artificial intelligence (AI) DeepSeek AI Electronics Sensors Connect The Team Advertise Join Us Newsletters Resources RSS Feeds Our Brands Fierce Wireless Fierce Telecom StreamTV Insider Fierce Electronics Our Events Electronics Entertainment Wireless & Telecom ©2025 Questex LLC All rights reserved.

    "instruct_article": "For a few months now, I’ve been referring to today’s heightened geopolitical climate as the “new red Cold War,” where artificial intelligence — not necessarily fighter jets and nuclear weapons — serves as the primary battleground between the U.S. and its adversaries, most notably Russia and China. The numbers tell a compelling story. According to one research firm, the global AI market in aerospace and defense is projected to surge from approximately $28 billion today to a staggering $65 billion by 2034. That’s a solid 9.91% compound annual growth rate. North America alone represents $10.43 billion of this market, and it’s growing even faster at 10.02%, annually. We’re seeing a dramatic reshuffling of the traditional defense sector hierarchy. Take Palantir Technologies. The AI-focused company — founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, among others, and named for a magical artifact from “Lord of the Rings”— has seen its stock soar approximately 61% so far this year, after returning a massive 340% in 2024. Meanwhile, traditional defense giants like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics have been struggling, with their combined market value now lower than that of Palantir, whose chief technology officer, Shyam Sankar, recently called the competition between the U.S. and China an “AI arms race.” And let’s not discount the influence of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency initiative. We could see a push to modernize military procurement, prioritizing software, drones and robots over traditional hardware. DOGE has already sent tremors through the defense sector, with traditional contractor stocks taking hits as new players like SpaceX, OpenAI and Anduril Industries gain ground. This shift isn’t happening in a vacuum, of course. The Trump administration, with Vice President JD Vance at the forefront, is actively pushing for AI development while taking a notably different approach from our European allies. At the AI Action Summit in Paris last week, Vance made it clear that the U.S. won’t let excessive regulation stifle innovation in this critical sector. “We need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation,” Vance told the audience, which included world leaders, CEOs and scientists from over 100 countries. This pro-growth stance has already benefited U.S. chipmakers like Intel, whose shares ended last week up more than 23% on news of increased support for domestic chip production. The company has its work cut out for it: Today, some 90% of the world’s most advanced chips are made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Even Google, once hesitant about military contracts, has reversed its stance on AI weapons development. This shift signals a broader change in Silicon Valley’s relationship with defense contracts, opening up new investment opportunities in tech companies that previously stayed away from the sector. The transformation isn’t limited to the U.S. Facing its own security challenges with Russia, Europe is seeing unprecedented growth in defense tech investment. Venture capital funding in defense technology hit a record $5.2 billion in 2024, according to a new report by Dealroom data. This marks an incredible fivefold jump from six years ago, making defense one of the fastest growing VC sectors in Europe right now. For investors, this creates what I see as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s target of 3% of GDP for defense spending — roughly $1 trillion annually — suggests sustained government investment in the sector, despite Musk’s promise to cut costs. The key question isn’t whether there will be spending, but rather which companies will capture it. So, where should investors be looking? I see three key areas: First, companies at the intersection of AI and defense, like Palantir, that are already proving their worth in military applications. These firms are positioning themselves as essential partners in modern warfare capabilities. Second, domestic semiconductor manufacturers like Intel that are critical to both AI development and national security. The Trump administration’s focus on U.S. production could provide significant tailwinds for these companies. And third, emerging defense tech companies that are disrupting traditional military procurement. While many are not publicly traded yet — Anduril being one such example — keeping an eye on this space could reveal early opportunities as they come to market. We’re witnessing the biggest transformation in defense technology since the advent of nuclear weapons, and I believe that those who position themselves in this new “AI arms race” could see substantial returns as this multi-decade trend unfolds.",
